This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

#Karl Pearson's Coeffecient of Correlation

kp_coef <- function(a, b){
  a <- as.numeric(a)
  b <- as.numeric(b)
  mean_a <- mean(a)
  mean_b <- mean(b)
  dev_a <- sd(a)*(length(a)^0.5)
  dev_b <- sd(b)*(length(b)^0.5)
  
  sd_a <- sd(a)
  sd_b <- sd(b)
  
  n <- sum(length(a), length(b))
  
  
  r = round((dev_a * dev_b)/(sd_a*sd_b*n), 3)
  r
}


Physics_Scores  <- c(15, 12,  8,  8,   7,   7,   7,   6,   5,   3)

History_Scores  <- c(10,  25,  17,  11,  13, 17,  20,  13,  9,   15)


kp_coef(Physics_Scores, History_Scores)


```

```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3)
b <- c(4,59,6)
sd(b)*length(b)


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
