#Karl Pearson's Coeffecient of Correlation


#Introduction: It is mathematical method where a numerical expression is used to estimate/calculate degree and direction of the relationship b/w linear related variables.

#Assumptions:
#1. Data is normally distributed.
#2. Variables are independent of each other   
#3. Relationship b/w variables is LINEAR


kp_coef <- function(a, b){
  a <- as.numeric(a) # conv both a and b to numeric datatype
  b <- as.numeric(b)
  mean_a <- mean(a)
  mean_b <- mean(b)
  dev_a <- sd(a)*(length(a)^0.5) # calculated deviation from Std deviation formula
  dev_b <- sd(b)*(length(b)^0.5)
  
  sd_a <- sd(a)
  sd_b <- sd(b)
  
  n <- sum(length(a), length(b)) # Total Num of observations
  
  
  r = round((dev_a * dev_b)/(sd_a*sd_b*n), 3) # Karl Pearson's Coeffecient of Correlation Formula

Physics_Scores  <- c(15, 12,  8,  8,   7,   7,   7,   6,   5,   3)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
